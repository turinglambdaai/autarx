# Autarx

**A modern AUTOSAR engineering workbench for inspecting, understanding, comparing, tracing and automating OEM-to-supplier integration data.**
Point it at an OEM delivery or ECU extract directory and get a semantic workspace: inventories, reference graphs, ECU discovery and unresolved-reference checks — scriptable end to end from an agent-friendly JSON CLI. Autarx sits **above** the vendor generators; it does not replace DaVinci, tresos or ISOLAR.

## Start here

Engineering preview; the complete official workbench is planned as a purchase. No paid checkout is open. Rivet desktop previews for macOS, Windows and Linux; CLI and MCP use the same Racket domain. Supported AUTOSAR scope is defined by the product contract, not every possible ARXML file.

## Why Autarx?

- **Deliveries are opaque** — an OEM drop is dozens of ARXML files with system descriptions, ECU extracts and ECUC bundles; nothing answers "what is in here, and does it hold together" without opening a full vendor toolchain
- **ARXML is grep-hostile** — engineers hand-navigate XML trees of millions of lines; tracing one signal from the ECU back to the cluster means mentally resolving dozens of REF elements across files
- **No automation surface** — CI cannot diff, trace or sanity-check deliveries because no vendor tool exposes a stable machine interface
- **Agents cannot help** — LLM agents work on text surfaces with structured feedback; vendor tools offer neither

Autarx fixes that: one UI-free semantic engine that reads ARXML directly, native workbenches for macOS, Windows and Linux, and a JSON-first CLI for scripts, CI and AI agents.

## What Autarx is — and is not

Autarx **can**: read ARXML workspaces, index identifiables with stable absolute paths, build forward/reverse reference graphs, search, trace, inspect, check basic consistency, emit deterministic JSON.

Autarx **does not**: replace DaVinci/tresos/ISOLAR, generate production BSW/RTE/MCAL code, or claim its validation substitutes for vendor validation. `validate` means structural checks only. The chain is: **Autarx analyses → Vendor Tool → Vendor Validation → Vendor Generator.** See [docs/PRODUCT.md](docs/PRODUCT.md).

## Features

- **Workspace semantic index** — every package-level identifiable gets a stable absolute short-name path (`/Vehicle/Signals/VehicleSpeed`); identity never relies on XML line numbers
- **Semantic classification** — systems, ECUs, clusters, frames, PDUs, signals, SW components, ports, interfaces, ECUC modules; unknown element types are reported honestly as unknown and never break parsing
- **Reference engine** — forward and reverse graphs over `*-REF`/`*-TREF` elements, cross-file resolution, nested-element attribution (`/Pdu_VehicleSpeed/VehicleSpeedMapping`), duplicate-path detection, unresolved-reference findings
- **OEM delivery inspection** — `inspect` reports files, sizes, element counts, packages, AUTOSAR namespace/schema/release and the full semantic inventory in one shot
- **ECU discovery** — `ecus` lists ECU instances; `ecu <name>` shows an ECU's direct relations with explicit `direct` relationship confidence (no guessed semantics)
- **Semantic diff** — `diff` compares two deliveries by path identity with content hashes; property-level explanations address ECUC values by their DEFINITION-REF, so "McuFrequency: 80000000 → 160000000" is a first-class finding, never a line-number noise
- **ECU impact analysis** — `impact --ecu RadarFL` classifies every change relevant/unrelated by closure over the union reference graph of both deliveries; deterministic ARX-IMP-* findings flag removed-referenced objects and type changes as breaking
- **Communication projection** — `comm` derives cluster → frame → PDU → signal chains from the reference graph and reports frames/PDUs/signals not attached anywhere; structural only, no invented sender/receiver semantics
- **Vendor hand-off** — `vendor list` detects DaVinci/tresos/ISOLAR installations; `vendor validate` relays the vendor tool's own run with normalized diagnostics and the raw output preserved — never an Autarx verdict
- **Reviewed editing** — `patch plan` previews every change as a semantic diff before anything is written; `patch apply` keeps backups and an undo manifest; renames rewrite incoming reference targets across the workspace
- **AI agent surface** — `autarx mcp` runs a Model Context Protocol stdio server exposing the whole tool API; there is no raw-write tool, so an agent cannot bypass the plan/diff/review boundary, and every call is audit-logged
- **Self-update** — every host updates in place through the Ed25519-signed feed: the macOS workbench polls `update-app-manifest.json` and one `Restart and Update` click downloads (with progress), verifies, swaps the bundle and relaunches (`Check for Updates…`, ⌘U); the Windows workbench does the same for portable installs and runs a passive MSI upgrade for per-installer copies; the Linux workbench verifies and downloads, then hands off with an open-folder dialog (AppImage installs swap in place and re-exec). The CLI's `autarx update` checks its own signed feed (the Ed25519-signed `update-manifest.json` published with every release), verifies the wrapper signature and the artifact SHA-256, and swaps the new binaries in place. Unhandled crashes leave a local log under `<TEMP>/autarx/crashes/` — nothing is sent anywhere
- **Agent-friendly CLI** — camelCase JSON, deterministic exit codes, ambiguity is reported instead of guessed; a ready-made command chain for CI gates
- **Native workbenches on all three desktops** — SwiftUI (macOS), WinUI 3 (Windows) and GTK4 (Linux) hosts over the same embedded Racket core, RPC surface and interaction model
- **Single binary core** — one Racket executable carries CLI + MCP; every GUI embeds it

## Install

Releases follow `autarx-<version>-<os>-<arch>.<ext>` and ship from
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/turlamai/autarx/releases):

| Download | Platform | Kind |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `autarx-<version>-macos-arm64.dmg` / `-x64.dmg` | macOS 14+, Apple silicon / Intel | GUI workbench |
| `autarx-<version>-windows-x64.msi` | Windows 10+ (x64) | GUI workbench |
| `autarx-<version>-linux-amd64.deb` / `-arm64.deb` | Linux (x64 / arm64) | GUI workbench |
| `autarx-<version>-linux-*.rpm` | Linux (x64 / arm64) | GUI workbench |
| `autarx-<version>-linux-x86_64.AppImage` / `-aarch64.AppImage` | Linux (x64 / arm64) | GUI workbench |
| `autarx-<version>-macos-arm64.zip` / `-x64.zip` | macOS (arm64 / x64) | CLI (self-contained) |
| `autarx-<version>-linux-x64.zip` / `-arm64.zip` | Linux (x64 / arm64) | CLI (self-contained) |
| `autarx-<version>-windows-x64.zip` | Windows (x64) | CLI (self-contained) |

The CLI zips are the self-update payload: once installed, `autarx update`
pulls newer builds from the signature-verified feed. The GUIs update
in place through the signed workbench feed (`*-app.zip` / `*-app.tar.gz`
payloads ship with every release). The DMG is ad-hoc signed — on first
launch, right-click the app and choose Open.

To build from source instead:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/turlamai/autarx.git
cd autarx
raco rivet build          # staged app + CLI runtime
racket racket/autarx/cli.rkt --version
```

Prerequisites: Racket CS 9.x with [Rivet](https://github.com/turlamai/rivet)
linked — see [Getting started](#getting-started) below for the full path.

## Getting started

### Build from source

Requirements: Racket CS 9.x with [Rivet](https://github.com/turlamai/rivet)
linked (inside a rivet checkout: `raco pkg install --auto --no-docs --name rivet --link file://$PWD`);
the macOS host additionally needs Xcode, the Windows host Visual Studio 2022
with the Windows App SDK, and the Linux host CMake + GTK4 (`libgtk-4-dev`
and friends). `raco rivet build` builds whichever host matches the current
platform.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/turlamai/autarx.git
cd autarx
raco rivet build          # staged layout: embedded backend + native host
racket racket/autarx/cli.rkt inspect shared/fixtures/OemDelivery --json
raco rivet dev            # dev loop: rebuild + launch the workbench
```

### Tests

```bash
raco test racket/
```

The 131-test suite (101 contract tests ported one-to-one from the .NET
suite plus the update-channel and workbench-updater tests) covers the
parser (namespace stripping, attributes, error line numbers), semantic
classification, workspace indexing, forward/reverse reference graphs,
traces, semantic diff, impact analysis, the communication projection,
validation, the patch pipeline, vendor hand-off normalization, version
comparison and both updater surfaces — over the same synthetic workspaces
in `shared/fixtures/`, including deliberate unresolved references and
ambiguous/duplicate paths.

## Design notes

- **Core is the semantic engine, not an ECUC parser** — ECUC is one projection; the top-level model (Workspace, SemanticObject, reference graph) must serve System Descriptions and ECU Extracts just as well
- **Identity = AUTOSAR absolute path** — stable across rewrites and diff-ready; XML line numbers are never identity
- **Unknown degrades gracefully** — an unmapped element type is indexed, referenceable and reported as unknown, never a parse failure
- **Ambiguity is surfaced, not guessed** — duplicate SHORT-NAMEs resolve to an explicit ambiguity result listing every candidate path
- **The CLI JSON is a machine contract** — camelCase keys, string enums, deterministic exit codes, additive changes only; scripts and AI agents depend on it

## Roadmap

The Rivet rebuild (R0–R8) is complete: Racket semantic core, CLI/MCP
with byte-compatible JSON, native macOS workbench, and the R0 performance
stop-rule record — see [docs/RIVET-MIGRATION.md](docs/RIVET-MIGRATION.md).
The workbench now ships natively on all three desktops (macOS, Windows,
Linux). The project is in a 0.x functional-validation phase; what remains
of M9 is commercial hardening — licensing, performance profiling on large
OEM deliveries, and code signing / notarization (see
[docs/ROADMAP.md](docs/ROADMAP.md)).
