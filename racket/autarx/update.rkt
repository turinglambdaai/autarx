;; Online update support for the autarx CLI, built on rivet/distribution —
;; the family pattern (taskly/brainfuel): the updater fetches and verifies
;; the Ed25519-signed channel manifest, selects the artifact for this
;; platform, and downloads it under size + SHA-256 enforcement from the
;; signed manifest. The CLI-specific install leg (unzip → locate the marker
;; executable → in-place file swap with `<name>.autarx-update.old` backups)
;; stays here.
;;
;; The feed is the family signed-wrapper format (schema + base64 payload +
;; Ed25519 signature block) at update-manifest.json — the same file name the
;; retired checksum feed used, now authenticated before a byte of it is
;; parsed (shared/spec/UPDATE.md). CLI builds up to 0.2.0 read that file as
;; a plain {version, assets} JSON document; against the signed wrapper they
;; report a failed check instead of an update and need a one-off manual
;; install to cross over.
;;
;; Timeouts: rivet's fetch-update-manifest / download-update bound the
;; response in bytes but not in time — net/url ports have no read deadline,
;; so a connection that stalls without RST/FIN would park the CLI forever.
;; Both network legs run on a supervised worker thread that a watchdog
;; breaks on the stall limit (no byte progress) or the total wall-clock
;; limit (the taskly updater's download watchdog, adapted to a synchronous
;; CLI instead of a background thread + UI state box — there is no RPC
;; consumer here to poll progress).
;;
;; Note on crypto factories: rivet/distribution pins the provider set to
;; libcrypto at module load and deliberately avoids crypto/all — factory
;; FFIs load at import time and the gmp factory kills embedded runtimes on
;; hosts without libgmp. This module runs inside the embedded CS runtime,
;; so it must not require crypto/all either (tests may, they are headless).
